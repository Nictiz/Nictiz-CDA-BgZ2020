:   AD.CA  Address (CA constraints)
:   Addresses are encoded with the street address sent as the value text of the address element, and additional address parts. Constraints for addresses are consistent with the requirements set out in the Pan Canadian Data Type Specification for the data type flavor AD.BASIC, with the exception of the fact that the pan Canadian Data Type specification pre-adopted coded state (province) and country elements from HL7â€™s release 2 Datatypes. Since CDA is fixed to release 1 datatypes, and the coded address parts are not available, the value for state and country address parts should be taken from the value sets assigned in the pan Canadian Datatype Specification.
